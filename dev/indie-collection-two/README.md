# Second original indie collection — games 21–40

This branch starts from public main `bded102680166c0107fd8a58fef1559be7a22efa`. The first-batch baseline was read from `dev/indie-collection/FINAL_REPORT.md` on `indie-collection-dev` at `c03682dc435ecdaacd94966273d789dd90e9f7b1`: 20 finished, nine selected, 66 meaningful passes, zero verified live URLs. All first-batch sources, save keys, catalogue entries and integrity checks are preserved.

`ledger.json` has exactly 20 new slots, numbered 21–40. Planned slots are design proposals, **not completed games**. The separate Nightshift collection does not count here. A slot is finished only after a playable loop, at least one meaningful improvement, campaign/progression and loss checks, saves/restart, responsive controls, launch/navigation and a recorded quality review. Selection is a separate decision after comparison across candidates.

## Development launch

Serve the repository root (`python -m http.server 8000`), then visit `http://localhost:8000/games/reefwright/` `http://localhost:8000/games/counterweight/`, `http://localhost:8000/games/lanternwake/` `http://localhost:8000/games/copper-cadence/` `http://localhost:8000/games/hollow-keeper/` `http://localhost:8000/games/paper-odyssey/` `http://localhost:8000/games/ratchet-run/` `http://localhost:8000/games/wellward/` `http://localhost:8000/games/salt-and-sail/` `http://localhost:8000/games/pocket-palaeo/` `http://localhost:8000/games/static-orchard/` or `http://localhost:8000/games/borrowed-gravity/`. The public catalogue intentionally does not list unselected candidates. No compile step or runtime dependencies are needed. All game illustrations are original inline SVG/CSS/Canvas; no outside game or asset collection was imported.

## Checks

- `node --test tests/reefwright-engine.cjs`
- `NODE_PATH=/path/to/test/node_modules node --test tests/reefwright-dom.cjs` (jsdom 26)
- `NODE_PATH=/path/to/test/node_modules node tests/reefwright-browser.cjs` (Playwright Chromium; owns its local server)
- `python tests/indie-two-gate.py` enforces the exact twenty-slot ledger and selection policy.
- `node tests/reefwright-solve.cjs` regenerates deterministic five-coast campaign fixtures. Do not regenerate fixtures to conceal a regression.
- `python tests/assets.py` and `python tests/selected-indie.py` preserve the public catalogue and first-batch source hashes.

Counterweight checks use the same test dependency setup:

- `node --test tests/counterweight-engine.cjs`
- `NODE_PATH=/path/to/test/node_modules node --test tests/counterweight-dom.cjs`
- `NODE_PATH=/path/to/test/node_modules node tests/counterweight-browser.cjs`
- `node tests/counterweight-solve.cjs` computes shortest clean per-delivery routes for the authored destination plans. The physical-direction improvement deliberately reversed ballast inputs; all five route lengths and medals remained unchanged.

## Current result and next work

**12/20 playable, improved and finished; 0 selected, integrated or verified live.** Borrowed Gravity is the twelfth finished development candidate. Eight slots remain concepts. First-batch games, Nightshift and Afterlight are excluded.

Borrowed Gravity adds ceiling/wall platforming through conserved source/barrier transfers. Four galleries unlock a steady harness and extended reach. Its improvement adds exact no-input drift forecasts, safe-return guards, jump buffering and ledge grace, plus clearer feedback. The candidate passed 38 checks (23 engine, 15 DOM), all four native desktop/touch galleries, exact paused reloads, scanner loss/retry, isolated recovery/reset and navigation. The campaign is short; no human play-duration claim is made.

[Exact-source CI 40002581593](https://github.com/ThatOneMop/study-desk/actions/runs/40002581593) includes all twelve candidates. Its engine/interface job passed **488 checks** (277 engine, 211 DOM), plus public integrity gates. Native suites are preserved in four groups with at most three concurrent jobs. Ten native suites passed; the Wellward/Ratchet Run group was still installing dependencies at handoff, so whole-workflow success is not claimed. The new-games artifact contains [28 Borrowed Gravity and 28 Static Orchard screenshots](https://github.com/ThatOneMop/study-desk/actions/runs/40002581593/artifacts/12523620121); representative desktop/phone images were reviewed. See the [Borrowed Gravity report](RUN_REPORT_2026-10-24_BORROWED_GRAVITY.md) and [comparison](COMPARISON.md).

The latest public release [39925660833](https://github.com/ThatOneMop/study-desk/actions/runs/39925660833) still fails at Configure GitHub Pages before upload. Publishing is blocked; development continues.

All implemented candidates follow the same dependency setup: `node --test tests/<game>-engine.cjs`, jsdom `tests/<game>-dom.cjs`, and Chromium `tests/<game>-browser.cjs`. Authoring solvers provide reference routes, not general optimality proofs. Never regenerate fixtures to conceal a regression. Copper Cadence's independent unbraked-prefix search checks its third commission's teaching constraint.

Next: implement, improve and test Tea for Ghosts, slot 33. Selection waits for broader comparison; reserve final work for improving the slate, choosing winners, integration and regression.

Keep future commits scoped to this collection. Re-read remote main and development heads before writes; never force-push over concurrent work. Preserve the new relaxed Study Desk layout and all Gummy Bay/requested-game work.

## Writing and evidence notes

Git CLI reads work in this environment but CLI push had no credentials. Supported GitHub create-tree/create-commit and leased update-ref tools preserved source successfully. Always inspect the current branch before writes and include its latest tree/parent; do not overwrite concurrent work.

The public `catalog-launch.cjs` and `curation-regression.cjs` tests are stale against base main: both still click the removed `playerStudy` button. These tests and public shell files are unchanged here. Current `dom-checks.cjs`, `bridge-pointer.cjs` and `relaxed-collection.cjs` pass. See the ledger and run report for the evidence boundary.

At the first increment’s concurrency check, public main had advanced to `013a8d009286fe02a37ebce76126f44c19c72ecf` with private-messaging links/docs. This branch did not write main. Re-read and preserve those changes when later integrating selected games.
